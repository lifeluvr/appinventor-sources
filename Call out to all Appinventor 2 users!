# New AppInventor Resources Repository On Github!
## AI2ezBuildFiles on GitHub!

Howdy! 
I'm putting together a github repo full of tutorials, .aia learning examples and app templates, .aix extensions for the test server,
the best portable AI2 home server and downloadable .bat files that, when clicked, open up Google Chrome to one of the many different
AI2 servers (home server too)! 
There's also .png and .jpg photo assets (I just got Adobe's PhotoShop and, I don't know it very well..yet. I'm more of a Gimp guy).

My repo is still in it's early stages but, it's growing fast and I have a ton of ideas! Here at github the sky's the limit! 
It may even grow up to be a beautiful web page :)

Anyhow, I just wanted to put the word out if anyone wants to play with the toys :)

Gitub Forks and Contributors are welcome and appreciated :) 
  *Let's see what this can turn into!
